# Boilerplate
This is my personal boilerplate which contains essential tools needed when developing web application with NodeJS.
It can be used as a template when starting to develop a web application.
More tools will be added as I discover something useful.

### Usage
1. Clone or download to your computer
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev-server` during development to test out your code
4. Run `npm run build` to build for deployment to production
